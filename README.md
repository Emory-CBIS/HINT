# Hierarchical Independent Analysis Toolbox (HINT)

The Hierarchical INdependent component analysis Toolbox (HINT), is Matlab toolbox that serves as a platform for hierarchical ICA techniques. The toolbox currently supports hierarchical ICA as described in Shi and Guo (2017). 

## Usage

Run the HINT.m file in Matlab to start the Toolbox. A user guide is provided in the docs folder.

## Toolboxes Included

* [GIFT] (http://mialab.mrn.org/software/gift/) - Used to obtain an initial guess for the EM algorithm.
* [BSMAC] (http://web1.sph.emory.edu/bios/CBIS/software.html#) - Used for several of the UI elements in the display window.
* [mtimesx] (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25977-mtimesx-fast-matrix-multiply-with-multi-dimensional-support) - Used to speed up computation.
* [NIFTI Toolbox] (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8797-tools-for-nifti-and-analyze-image) - Used for reading and writing nii files.
* [FASTICA] (https://research.ics.aalto.fi/ica/fastica/) - Used in initial pre-processing.
