# Hierarchical Independent Component Analysis Toolbox (HINT)

The Hierarchical INdependent component analysis Toolbox (HINT), is Matlab toolbox that serves as a platform for hierarchical ICA techniques. The toolbox currently supports hierarchical ICA as described in Shi and Guo (2016). 

Supported by the National Institute of Mental Health under Award Number R01MH105561. 

## Usage

Run the HINT.m file in Matlab to start the Toolbox.

## Toolboxes Included

* [mtimesx] (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25977-mtimesx-fast-matrix-multiply-with-multi-dimensional-support) - Used to speed up computation.
* [NIFTI Toolbox] (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8797-tools-for-nifti-and-analyze-image) - Used for reading and writing nii files.
* [FASTICA] (https://research.ics.aalto.fi/ica/fastica/) - Used in initial pre-processing.

## Versioning

HINT's 2.0 release was 5/23/2022. This release includes longitudinal hc-ICA.
