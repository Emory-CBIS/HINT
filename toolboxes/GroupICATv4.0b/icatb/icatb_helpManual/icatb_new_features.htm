<h4> New Features </h4>
<hr>

<b> GroupICAT v4.0b (Feb 20, 2017): </b>
<ul>
<li> A subject outlier detection tool is now added as a "Generate Mask" utility in the GIFT toolbox. An average mask is generated and subjects below a certain correlation threshold are 
excluded from the analysis. At the end of the mask generation, a GIFT batch file is created which can be used to run the group ICA. </li>
<li> An option is now provided to generate results summary in the Mancovan toolbox. This tool can be accessed using "display" button in the Mancovan toolbox. 
Univariate results are plotted in a separate figure for each significant covariate and a connectogram display (Rashid, B., et al. (2014), 
"Dynamic connectivity states estimated from resting fMRI Identify differences among Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and healthy control subjects", Frontiers in 
human neuroscience) is used to show the FNC plots.</li>
<li> We now provide an option in the Mancovan toolbox to run univariate tests using the selected covariates bypassing the multivariate tests. This tool can be accessed using 
"Run analysis" button in the Mancovan toolbox. </li>
<li> The "Group networks" tool is renamed to a more general "network summary" in the GIFT display tools. The network summary display uses the component network information and 
optional FNC information to generate composite orthogonal views (Damaraju, E., et al. (2014), â€œDynamic functional connectivity analysis reveals transient states of dysconnectivity 
in schizophrenia", NeuroImage), composite rendered surfaces of brain, stacked orthogonal slices, FNC matrix viewer and connectogram FNC plot. </li>
<li> We now provide an option to use the temporal design matrix information in the "Results Summary" button to compute R-square and one sample t-test on beta weights in the GIFT toolbox.
 This tool can also be accessed as temporal sorting under "Utilities" drop down box. </li>
<li> The stand-alone image viewer tool is now enabled to select multiple component images which can be plotted independently or in a composite plot (montage, render or orthogonal slices). </li>
<li> An option is now provided to export results to PDF or HTML file in the component viewer display tool. </li>
<li> MOO-ICAR algorithm name is changed to GIG-ICA. </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<b> GroupICAT v4.0a (May 02, 2015): </b>

<ul> 
<li> Group ICA command line tool ("gica_cmd") is now added to the toolbox. Batch script can be run with minimal options from the MATLAB command line.</li>
<li> Two more PCA methods are now integrated in the GIFT toolbox (early work based on: S. Rachakonda and V. D. Calhoun, "Efficient Data Reduction in Group ICA Of fMRI Data," in Proc. HBM, Seattle, WA, 2013, and in two papers currently under review)
<ul>
<li> Option to do PCA using Multi power iteration (MPOWIT) is now added. MPOWIT accelerates subspace iteration approach to extract dominant components from the data with very high accuracy in only a few iterations. MPOWIT can be run with data available in memory or by loading one data-set at a time. </li>
<li>Subsampled time PCA (STP) based on three data reduction method is now integrated in the toolbox. STP avoids whitening in the intermediate PCA step and PCA subspace is updated based on previous group estimates and new group entered. [note this addresses previous issues related to performance of three-step PCA]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Parallel computing is now incorporated. Group ICA makes use of parallel computing toolbox to speed up the analysis stage. If parallel computing toolbox is not available, independent MATLAB sessions are used to speed up the process. The following tools are run in parallel:
<ul>
<li> Dimensionality Estimation</li>
<li> Subject level PCA</li>
<li> Stability analysis using ICASSO or Minimum spanning tree (MST)</li>
<li> Back reconstruction using spatial temporal regression or MOO-ICAR methods</li>
<li> Scaling components</li>
<li> Removing components</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Standalone image display tools like montage, orthogonal viewer, rendering and grouping components by network names are now integrated. </li>
<li> Option is provided to summarize group ICA results using an HTML report. </li>
<li> Spatial dynamic functional connectivity toolbox (sDFNC) is integrated. sDFNC toolbox is based on paper S. Ma, V. Calhoun, R. Phlypo and T. Adali, &#8220;Dynamic changes of spatial function network connectivity in healthy individuals and schizophrenia patients using independent vector analysis&#8221;, NeuroImage, 90 (2014), 196-206.</li>
<li> Options are now provided to run both temporal and spatial ICA on pre-processed data directly. </li>

</ul>

<hr>

<b> GroupICAT v3.0a (May 21, 2013): </b>

<ul>
<li> A new dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) toolbox is integrated within the GIFT toolbox. Please see E. Allen, E. Damaraju, S. M. Plis, E. Erhardt, T. Eichele, and V. D.Calhoun, "Tracking whole-brain connectivity dynamics in the resting state", Cereb Cortex, in press. The approach has also recently been validated using concurrent EEG/fMRI (see E. Allen, T. Eichele, L. Wu, and V. D. Calhoun, "EEG Signatures of Functional Connectivity States," in Human Brain Mapping, Seattle, WA, 2013).</li>
<li> A new algorithm for independent vector analysis (IVA-GL) is integrated into the GIFT toolbox. IVA-GL uses multi-variate gaussian prior and laplacian prior to do source separation from the data. Please see M. Anderson, T. Adali, & X.-L. Li, "Joint Blind Source Separation of Multivariate Gaussian Sources: Algorithms and Performance Analysis," IEEE Trans. Signal Process., 2012, 60, 1672-1683) and T. Kim, H. T. Attias, S.-Y. Lee, & T.-W. Lee, "Blind Source Separation Exploiting Higher-Order Frequency Dependencies," IEEE Trans. Audio Speech Lang. Process., 2007, 15, 70-79.</li>
<li> Multivariate Objective Optimization ICA with Reference (MOO-ICAR) is now integrated in the GIFT toolbox. MOO-ICAR uses a no data reduction approach and aggregate component maps from previous group ICA analysis as reference to estimate sources of interest for each subject. Please see Y. Du, Y. Fan, "Group information guided ICA for fMRI data analysis", NeuroImage 69: 157-197 (2013).</li>
<li> Constrained ICA (Spatial) approach is updated to allow for the no data reduction approach similar to MOO-ICAR method above.</li>
<li> PCA using eigen decomposition method is modified to compute the covariance matrix along the smallest dimension of the data.</li>
<li> Statistics tool to compute T-test, ANOVA and Multiple Regression on subject ICA loading coefficients have now been added to the SBM toolbox.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<b>GroupICAT v2.0d with the release date March 31, 2010: </b>

<ul>

<li> Added data pre-processing options like intensity normalization, variance 
normalization and removing mean time-series. Intensity normalization is 
recommended for maximizing the reliability and replicability of the components. 
Please see E. Allen, E. Erhardt, T. Eichele, A. R. Mayer, and V. D. Calhoun, "Comparison of pre-normalization methods on the accuracy of group ICA results," in Proc. HBM, Barcelona, Spain, 2010 for more details. </li>

<li> Added expectation maximization option to PCA computation (S.Roweis, &quot;EM 
algorithms for PCA and sensible PCA&quot;, Advances in Neural Information Processing 
Systems. 1998). EM PCA has fewer memory constraints compared to covariance based 
PCA and is the preferred method for very large data-set analysis. </li>


<li> All the subsequent analysis MAT files after PCA with the exception of 
ICASSO will be converted to single precision if you have selected single 
precision in the PCA options. This is recommended for maximizing the number of 
data sets given a fixed amount of RAM. </li>

<li> GICA3 back reconstruction method was released as an update to GroupICAT 
v2.0c. GICA3 is the recommended method for reconstructing individual subject 
components with the most accurate spatial maps and timecourses. GICA3 has two 
desirable properties that the sum of the subject spatial maps is the aggregate 
spatial map and the product of the time courses and spatial maps estimate the 
data to the accuracy of the PCA's. We have performed extensive comparison with 3 
different PCA/data-reduction approaches and 4 back-reconstruction approaches 
including spatio-temporal regression/dual regression. These approaches are 
included as options in GIFT. Please see E. Erhardt, S. Rachakonda, E. Bedrick, T. Adali, and V. D. Calhoun, "Comparison of multi-subject ICA methods for analysis of fMRI data," in Proc. HBM, Barcelona, Spain, 2010. 
 </li>

<li> Component images sign in ICA is flipped based on the skewness measure of 
the distribution (previously it was flipped based upon the maximum voxel). </li>


<li> Subject component image distributions are centered to zero by default when 
scaling component images. Centering is done based on the peak of the 
distribution. </li>

<li> &quot;icatb_mem_ica.m&quot; script is updated to include all the data reduction 
strategies and will give a close estimate of how much RAM is required for all 
the analysis types. </li>


<li> ICASSO can now be acessed from Setup ICA GUI. </li>

<li> Dimensionality estimation source code (&quot;icatb_estimate_dimension.m&quot;) 
developed by Leo Li is now available. </li>

<li> Batch script doesn't read &quot;numOfPC3&quot; variable if only two data reduction 
steps are used. </li>

<li> Bug was fixed in the back reconstruction code (GroupICAT v2.0c Updates, 
March 11, 2010) to handle &quot;Constrained ICA (Spatial)&quot; algorithm. </li>

<li> Covariance options is replaced with PCA options and will be available when 
you select the PCA type in Setup ICA GUI. </li>

</ul>

<hr>

<b>GroupICAT v2.0c with the release date August 17, 2009: </b>

<ul>

<li> Enabled two data reduction steps in Setup ICA when the number of subjects 
is greater than 10. </li>
<li> Two data reduction steps method is handled better in terms of memory usage 
for analyzing very large datasets. </li>
<li> Added C-MEX files for computing eigen values of a symmetric matrix using 
packed storage scheme (this approach is slightly slower, but less memory 
intensive).</li>
<li> Added spatial-temporal back reconstruction approach (this is an alternative 
approach to back-reconstruction and computes a spatial regression of the 
aggregate component images onto each timepoint of the single subject data and 
then computes a temporal regression of the single subject component timecourses 
onto each voxels timecourse). Results are quite similar to back-reconstruction 
using the PCA de-whitening matrix.</li>

</ul>

<hr>

<b>GroupICAT v2.0b with the release date April 2, 2009: </b>
<ul>
<li> Single trial amplitudes utility based on Dr. Tom Eichele's work is now 
added to the GIFT toolbox.</li>
<li> Added an option in the batch script to select the input data using regular 
expression pattern match. This can be used to get the directories that are 
highly nested.</li>
<li> We now remove the limitation to use MATLAB Statistics toolbox to compute 
statistics on the time courses. </li>
<li> Added Multiple Regression design criteria in the Stats on time courses GUI. </li>
<li> Percent variance calculation is added in the Utilities Section.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<b>GroupICAT v2.0a with the release date April 11, 2008: </b>
<ul>

Eichele). EEGIFT contains options for importing data in .SET format from EEGLAB 
and visualization methods for viewing group ICA components. Both GIFT and EEGIFT 
are subsumed within GroupICAT v2.0a.</li>

<li> Temporal sorting in GIFT is optimized. We load .MAT files for individual 
subject components instead of using time course images.</li>
<li> Event average using deconvolution method (By Tom Eichele) is implemented. </li>
<li> Event average utility in main figure window now has the options for 
selecting multiple regressors and components. Event average results will be
