This window can be used to generate the full output of the HINT program 
based on previously saved results from the EM algorithm.

HINT outputs the state of the parameter estimates after each EM iteration. By 
default, the most recent 2 iterations are saved. The variables in these .mat
files can be used to generate all output needed for visualizing the study results.

To do this, use the provided buttons to select an output folder, the iteration results
that you want to use, and the runinfo file that was used in the analysis. Optionally,
you can also provide an alternative mask file, in case the mask file in the runinfo 
file is not longer valid.
