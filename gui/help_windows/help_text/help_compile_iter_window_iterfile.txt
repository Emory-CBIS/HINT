HINT writes out the current state of the parameter estimates after each
iteration of the EM algorithm. These files can be used to check the current
state of the estimates, or to generate a new set of output if the original
output is lost or deleted. The files should be of the form iter#_parameter_estimates.mat
where # is the iteration number.
