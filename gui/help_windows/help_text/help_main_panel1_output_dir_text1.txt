The output directory is where all results from the analyses you perform on this data will be stored.

After performing preprocessing and obtaining initial values for the model parameters, you will be asked to provide an analysis-specific prefix. 

The HINT toolbox will create a subfolder within the output directory you specified to contain the analysis-specific results.

This means that you can store several analyses within this folder. See example.
