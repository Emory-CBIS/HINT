By default, HINT will automatically load the mask file provided in the
runinfo file. However, in some cases, that mask file may not exist. This
can happen if some folders were rearranged, or if the analysis was conducted
on a remote server and now the results are being compiled on a local machine.

Selecting "manually specify mask location" will tell HINT to override the mask
in the runinfo file with whatever mask you select using the "Select Mask" button.
This should prevent any potential errors if HINT needs to load the mask
at a later stage.
