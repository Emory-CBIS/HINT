The mask is used to isolate the brain (or gray matter) voxels from the rest of the image.
\nThe mask should be in NIFTI format.
\nNote that the mask (and all subject fMRI nii files) should be registered to a common space. This can be a well known template space such as 2mm MNI space or Talaraich space, or an average subject space generated from your data.
\nIf you have registered to a common templace space, such as MNI, then there are likely pre-made masks you can use.
